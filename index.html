<h1><em><font color="orange">The supreme court, as of april 15th 2024 has ruled against mass protest in 3 states.</font></em></h1>
<p><font color="orange">In the States, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, it is no longer safe to organize a protest. The Supreme Court's decision that it will not hear Mckesson v. Doe leaves a lower court decision that effectively eliminates the federal right to organize a mass protest by leaving the choice to punish organizers to the state. In the states listed protest organizers can be punished. That is against our first ammendment right of free speach. <em>That is fascism.</em> Removing the right to protest on any scale revokes the right to oppose the government. When we are no longer allowed to oppose the government, this country is no longer "by the people for the people." - Lincoln, Gettysburg Address. The freedom to protest on a federal level has been removed. That should anger you. No matter where you are on the political spectrum. As an American, <em>you should be angry.</em></font></p>
